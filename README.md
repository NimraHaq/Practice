# Practice
#this a a practice file for learning gitHub

I cloned this "Practice" repository into my local machine.
Then I created a file named "practice.html" in the practice folder.
I added this file in the stagging area. _git add practice.html_
I commited this file.  _git commit -m 'practice.html'_
Now the file is present in my local version control system.
By _git push_  I pushed the file to my repository at the gitHub.
To check status , I used _git status_
